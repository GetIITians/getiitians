      getIITians is Indiaâ€™s first online platform which provides 1-to-1 tutoring service to the students. We aim to bring revolution in the traditional landscape of education where imparting knowledge is constraint by distance, timing and is teacher-centric. getIITians is a platform where knowledge transfer is not bounded by any such constraint and student is free to choose teacher of their choice , study at his/her convenient time and place. We understand that every student is different with their own set of strengths and personal  mentorship is the key to hone and polish those skillset. Hence our entire team including teachers provides strong emphasis on personal mentorship , understanding students psyche, designing test paper/study material accordingly and provide constant motivation to give their best in life.

      How we started
    </h3>

  <div class="row">
    <p class="col-xs-12">
      We started in 2012,  when co-founder along with 3 other IITians started providing home tuitions to students. They realized that parents valued mentorship , ability of teachers to arouse interest in the subject and the way we conducted test analysis and students enjoyed personal connect with the teacher as they have gone through similar high pressure situation. Thus we decided to create a platform where IITians teachers with strong interest in teaching can impart knowledge online to students across the globe.
